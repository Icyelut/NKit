Outstanding Issues
+ ProcessorApp to show before and after size - put before size in on scan?
+ Enable extracting recovery info from the nkit format

- Fixed NkitReencode. It was always reencoding and not copying the NKit file when converting nkit.iso <-> nkit.gcz
- Fixed Verify not outputting any log detail messages e.g. When a removed Update Partition is required to verify and was not present - no message was output, it just failed
- Moved the SummaryLog to the Processed folder rather than the app folder to make it more obvious
- Added settings home support. ~ at the start of a Path will insert the user's home directory (all OSs)
